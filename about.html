<h2>About</h2>
  <p>Innovation is the new sensation.

    As a future software programmer, I am so glad you decided to visit my site and learn more about me and all of the work I have done. I am a diligent, ambitious student with many passions while on my journey to graduation this year with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
    However, what I love most in life is learning about new subjects and skill sets. I am here to show you what I have learned regarding website designs and prototypes and software application development, and hopefully, spark an interest in your mind as well.
    I chose this field and profession of work because technology and science have always fascinated me since my early childhood of reading books of all kinds, which developed into my passion for knowledge and learning. I also chose this field because I have the personality to help people overcome any obstacles of life, including linguistics, especially while working in nursing for six years in hospitals and care facilities with patients of all populations and demographics.</p>

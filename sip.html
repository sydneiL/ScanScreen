<h2>SIP Innovation</h2>


<p>This is an online language learning application designed for students of all ages and demographics worldwide from children to working adults, especially if they have any audible or verbal disabilities as deaf people have heightened senses of sound while those coping with deafness have heightened senses of voice and the spoken word. Students will learn to identify basic words and phrases, foods, people, numbers, and public buildings using verbal examples. Language exams will feature the options of choosing subjects that they learned such as how to say specific or words in sentences and questions. By teaching people how fun it can be to learn different languages despite their physical, verbal, and audible disabilities, they can develop and maintain a sense of self-confidence that will only serve to benefit them and everyone around the world as well as people in their local communities to avoid any discrimination or abuse. The linguistic and translation application could be expanded to offer advanced levels for older retirees to keep their minds active to stave off any neurological diseases most prominent among that population demographic.
    
Technical Field- This project involves the intricate field of Advancing Computer Science.

Background Information- Why I choose to innovate in the world of computer science and linguistics, you ask? Well, the answers are easy. First off, as an aspiring software developer with experience in nursing and patient care, you wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent conversing with people of diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds and I often had issues with communication due to language barriers. Wouldn't you rather use a more proficient application that would interact with you just by using your voice without the need for a daunting setup, lack of mobile support, free trial, or auto-save? You may see the concept of a mobile application with expensive pricing or limited support as a fantastic idea but most people can't afford the costly monthly plans so this concept would be useless and ridiculous. Which is my proposed resolution to this problem is ScanScreen.



Prior Art



I was fortunate enough to find extensive research on the history of language learning technology throughout the centuries before the conception of computers from the invention of the Gutenberg printing press of the Renaissance and the Magic Lantern to the language labs of the 1950s. According to the research found on the website of The National Museum of Language, 



Project Description-



The full deliverable of this project would be a working prototype of an application with the eventual inclusion of an AI chatbot activated by voice that would increase the user experience for my audience. My project will also entail that it will possess effective virtual communication and scanning abilities benefiting my consumers by helping them become masterful of linguistics and vocal scanning as well as learning whatever languages they are fluent in from birth or languages that are mandatory for users to increase their educational and employment opportunities.



Innovation Claim-



ScanScreen is innovative because it allows users who are impaired in speech and hearing or not to choose and learn different languages through voice activation and recognition. The interface gives users to decide what languages they want to learn using their voice, regardless of how impaired their speech patterns are. 



The goal of ScanScreen is to allow impaired users the freedom to learn all known spoken and written languages in the world via the power of voice recognition as verbal communication is essential to both impaired and non-impaired users.







EVALUATION CRITERIA



User Interface-



1. Does the interface give users easy navigation within virtual world?

2. Is the interface comprehensible and interactive for potential users?

3. Is the interface available in all written languages for non-English speakers?

4.Is the interface comprehensible for the audible and verbally impaired?



Voice Recognition Software-



1. Is the voice recognition software audible enough for both users who are hearing impaired and users who aren’t?

2. Does the voice recognition software provide adequate answers to all questions asked by users?

3. Is the voice recognition software easy to download to iOS?



Virtual Streams-

​

Does the virtual stream run smoothly for every recorded live lesson or does it buffer constantly?

Can the user hear the sound of the recorded lessons from their tutors or do they have trouble downloading the software?

​

DESIGN DESCRIPTION PROTOTYPE



The system which my innovation project will be build on regarding the design prototype are either mobile or desktop, meaning that it will only be available for Apple devices and users will be able to run the prototype by downloading the application via on all devices. I wrote the code for ScanScreen on VSCode because VSCode is a free coding application simple for even the most novice computer programmers to use the interfaces available on all platforms except for mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. The operation of ScanScreen should be user-friendly and the initial setup would require users to gain network access via Wi-Fi and hotspot networks.
